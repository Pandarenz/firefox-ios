/**
 * ScreenGraph helps you get rid of the navigation boiler plate found in a lot of whole-application UI testing.
 *
 * You create a shared graph of UI 'screens' or 'scenes' for your app, and use it for every test.
 *
 * In your tests, you use a navigator which does the job of getting your tests from place to place in your application,
 * leaving you to concentrate on testing, rather than maintaining brittle and duplicated navigation code.
 * 
 * The shared graph may also have other uses, such as generating screen shots for the App Store or L10n translators.
 *
 * Under the hood, the ScreenGraph is using GameplayKit's path finding to do the heavy lifting.
